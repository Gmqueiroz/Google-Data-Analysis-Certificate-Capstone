Cyclistic Google Capstone - Power Bi Dashboard images

This files represent 3 crucial stages of the cyclistic database analysis:

The MM.full shows the overall summary of all the trips that occurred in the second semester of 2019 in chicago using the cyclistic bikes.

The MM.sub shows the summary of trips done by a paid member of the cyclistic subscription program.

And the MM.cust shows the summary of trips done by casual riders, that rents outside the subscription program.
